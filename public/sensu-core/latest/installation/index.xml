      <description>The complete installation guide The purpose of this guide is to help provide new and experienced Sensu users alike with a detailed guide for installing and configuring Sensu into a variety of operating environments. By default, this guide will direct you to install and configure Sensu Core or Sensu Enterprise in a standalone configuration.
If you are a new Sensu user – or if you have only ever used automation tools like Chef, Puppet, or Ansible to install and configure Sensu – working through this installation guide for the exercise alone is strongly recommended.</description>

      <description>Sensu&amp;rsquo;s architecture is one of its most compelling features. It is flexible enough to be installed on a single system for development/testing/lab purposes (or small production environments), and sophisticated enough to support highly available configurations capable of monitoring infrastructure at scale.
Please review the following definitions of standalone, distributed, and high-availability installation strategies to help you select which one will be the most appropriate for your installation. If you&amp;rsquo;re just getting started with Sensu and/or if you&amp;rsquo;re not sure which strategy to choose, follow the instructions for a standalone installation.</description>

      <description>As mentioned earlier in this guide, Sensu&amp;rsquo;s architecture is one of its most compelling features. While this modular design makes it infinitely adaptable to monitor any infrastructure, it also depends on some external services to function:
Data Store (Redis) Transport NOTE: this guide will focus on installing Sensu&amp;rsquo;s dependencies in a standalone configuration. However, in a live/production environment, it is strongly recommended that – at minimum – the Sensu data store and transport run on a different system than the Sensu server and API (i.</description>

      <guid>/sensu-core/latest/installation/install-sensu-server-api/</guid>
      <description>The Sensu Server and API are available in two flavors:
Sensu Core Sensu Enterprise NOTE: only one flavor of the Sensu server &amp;amp; API should be used at any given time. Sensu Enterprise users should skip Sensu Core server &amp;amp; API installation and jump directly to installing Sensu Enterprise.
Sensu Core (OSS) IMPORTANT: Sensu Core reached end-of-life (EOL) on December 31, 2019, and we permanently removed the Sensu EOL repository on February 1, 2021.</description>

      <description>Having successfully installed and configured a Sensu server and API (Sensu Core or Sensu Enterprise), let&amp;rsquo;s now install and/or configure a Sensu client. The Sensu client is run on every system you need to monitor, including those running the Sensu server and API, and Sensu&amp;rsquo;s dependencies (i.e. RabbitMQ and/or Redis). Both Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise use the same Sensu client process (i.e. sensu-client), so upgrading from Sensu Core to Sensu Enterprise does not require you to install a difference Sensu client.</description>

      <description>Sensu was originally designed as an API-based monitoring solution, enabling operations teams to compose monitoring solutions where Sensu provides the monitoring instrumentation, collection of telemetry data, scalable event processing, comprehensive APIs – and plugins for sending data to dedicated dashboard solutions. However, as the Sensu Core project and community have matured, the need for an optional Sensu dashboard has become more obvious. As a result, there are now two (2) dashboard solutions for Sensu: Uchiwa (for Sensu Core users), and the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard (for Sensu Enterprise customers).</description>

      <description>Redis is a key-value database, which describes itself as &amp;ldquo;an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value cache and store&amp;rdquo;. Sensu uses Redis for storing persistent data. Two Sensu services, the server and API, require access to the same instance of Redis to function. Although it is possible to install and run Redis on almost any modern operating system, all Sensu users are encouraged to install and run Redis on one of the following supported platforms:</description>

      <description>RabbitMQ is a message bus that describes itself as &amp;ldquo;a messaging broker - an intermediary for messaging. It gives your applications a common platform to send and receive messages, and your messages a safe place to live until received&amp;rdquo;. RabbitMQ is also the default Sensu Transport. When using RabbitMQ as the Sensu Transport, all Sensu services require access to the same instance (or cluster) of RabbitMQ to function. All Sensu users are encouraged to install and run RabbitMQ on one of the following supported platforms:</description>

Please see the official RabbitMQ installation guide for recommended installation strategies.
NOTE: It&amp;rsquo;s expected that if you install the rabbitmq-server package from the repository listed in the source above, that the requisite packages for Erlang will also be installed.</description>

      <description>Congratulations - you have successfully installed and configured the Sensu services, one or more Sensu clients, and a Sensu dashboard! With this basic implementation in place, you have the core Sensu platform available for development, testing and evaluation purposes. What&amp;rsquo;s next?
Next steps The installation guide provided manual, step-by-step instructions to help the user (that&amp;rsquo;s you) learn how Sensu is installed and configured. It would not be practical to manually install Sensu on every machine you wish to monitor.</description>

      <description>WARNING: Note that the biggest change in this release that may affect your deployment deals with our internal update to a newer Ruby. This means that plugins will have to be re-installed - and any old plugins will continue to persist on your filesystem.
Upgrading Sensu is usually a straightforward process. In most cases, upgrading Sensu and/or Sensu Enterprise only requires upgrading to the latest package. Certain versions of Sensu may include changes that are not backwards compatible and require additional steps be taken when upgrading.</description>

      <description>WARNING: Sensu prereleases are your first chance to try out new features and bug fixes. Please be aware that you may be the first to discover an issue, you probably do not want to use a prerelease in production.
Testing and using a Sensu prerelease is straightforward, it simply involves using a different package repository. You should only be using prereleases if you already have experience installing and managing a Sensu installation.</description>

      <description>We highly recommend using configuration management tools to deploy Sensu in production and at scale.
Pin versions of Sensu-related software to ensure repeatable Sensu deployments. Scale Sensu horizontally with additional Sensu, RabbitMQ, and Redis servers. Ensure consistent configuration between Sensu Servers. The following configuration management tools have well-defined Sensu modules to help you get started.
Puppet The Puppet Sensu module can be found on the Puppet Forge. Sensu has partnered with Tailored Automation to enhance the Puppet module with new features, bug fixes, and ensure Sensu 2.</description>

      <title>Installing &amp; Managing Plugins</title>

      <guid>/sensu-core/latest/installation/installing-plugins/</guid>
      <description>Sensu&amp;rsquo;s functionality can be extended through the use of plugins. Plugins can provide executables for performing status or metric checks, mutators for changing data to a desired format, or handlers for performing an action on a Sensu event. You can find a number of plugins in the Sensu Plugins repository.
NOTE: Plugins found in the Sensu Plugins GitHub organization are community-maintained, meaning that anyone can improve on a plugin found there.</description>
