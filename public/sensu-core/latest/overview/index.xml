      <description>A Simple, Yet Powerful Monitoring Event Pipeline Sensu is a comprehensive monitoring solution that is powerful enough to solve complex monitoring problems at scale, yet simple enough to use for traditional monitoring scenarios and small environments. It achieves this broad appeal via building upon two simple, yet powerful monitoring primitives: Service Checks and Event Processing. These building blocks also provide infinitely extensible pipelines for composing monitoring solutions.

      <description>The Sensu Monitoring Flow Publishing subscription check requests A Check Request is scheduled/published by the Sensu Server or a Sensu Client The Sensu Client executes a Service Check Service Checks emit status information and telemetry data as Check Results Check Results are considered to be associated with either the Sensu Client executing the check or the Proxy Client of the check Those Check Results are published by the Sensu Client to the Sensu Transport, sometimes on behalf of another client The Sensu Server processes Check Results, persisting a copy of the latest result in the Data Store and creating a corresponding to Event The Sensu Server processes the Event by executing one or more Event Handlers The Sensu Server applies any Event Filters defined for an Event Handler The Sensu Server applies any Event Data Mutators defined for an Event Handler (assuming the event was not filtered out) The Sensu Server executes the Event Handler (assuming the event was not filtered out) </description>

      <description>Architectural Overview One of advantages that Sensu provides over other monitoring solutions is its architecture, which facilitates the execution of service checks, collection of metric data, and event processing at scale. This architecture is comprised of the following components:
Secure Transport Data Store Check Execution Scheduler Monitoring Agent Event Processor RESTful API Architectural Diagram Secure Transport Sensu services use a message bus (e.g. RabbitMQ) to communicate with one another (technically speaking, the Sensu services don’t actually communicate with each other – they only communicate with the message bus).</description>

      <description>Sensu Core All versions of Sensu (including Sensu Enterprise) are based on the same core components and functionality, which are provided by the Sensu open-source software project and collectively referred to as Sensu Core. Sensu Core provides multiple processes, including the Sensu server (sensu-server), Sensu API (sensu-api), and Sensu client (sensu-client).
IMPORTANT: Sensu Core reached end-of-life (EOL) on December 31, 2019, and we permanently removed the Sensu EOL repository on February 1, 2021.</description>
