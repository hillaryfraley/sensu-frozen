Agents self-register with the backend, send keepalive messages, and execute monitoring checks. Each agent belongs to one or more subscriptions that determine which checks the agent runs. An agent can run checks on the entity itâ€™s installed on or connect to a remote proxy entity. Read more about the Sensu agent.
Asset An executable that a check, handler, or mutator can specify as a dependency.</description>
