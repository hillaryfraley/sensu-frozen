      <description>An entity represents anything that needs to be monitored, such as a server, container, or network switch, including the full range of infrastructure, runtime, and application types that compose a complete monitoring environment. Sensu uses agent entities, proxy entities, and service entities.
Sensu&amp;rsquo;s free entity limit is 100 entities. All commercial features are available for free in the packaged Sensu Go distribution for up to 100 entities. If your Sensu instance includes more than 100 entities, contact us to learn how to upgrade your installation and increase your limit.</description>

      <title>Automatically register and deregister entities</title>

      <description>Sensu uses the publish/subscribe pattern of communication, which allows automated registration and deregistration of ephemeral systems. Sensu agents automatically discover and register infrastructure components and the services running on them. At the same time, when an agent process stops, the Sensu backend can automatically create and process a deregistration event.
Automatic registration and deregistration keeps your Sensu instance up-to-date and avoids unnecessary process load, especially in containerized environments where containers routinely come online and offline.</description>

      <title>Monitor external resources with proxy entities</title>

      <description>Proxy entities allow Sensu to monitor external resources on systems and devices where a Sensu agent cannot be installed, like a network switch or a website. You can create proxy entities with sensuctl, the Sensu API, and the proxy_entity_name check attribute. When executing checks that include a proxy_entity_name or proxy_requests attribute, Sensu agents report the resulting event under the proxy entity instead of the agent entity.
This guide explains how to use a proxy entity to monitor website status, as well as how to use the proxy checks to monitor a group of websites.</description>
